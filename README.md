📝 Open-world Blog – Community Blog Platform

A community-driven blog platform built with HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
This project allows anyone to submit blogs instantly, while an admin can log in to manage (delete) posts. Blogs are stored in the browser using localStorage, so no external database or backend is required.

🚀 Features

✍️ Blog Submission Form – Users can add blogs with title, content, author name, and optional image.

📖 Instant Publishing – Submitted blogs appear immediately in the “Latest Blogs” section.

🛠 Admin Controls – Admin can log in (default password: uvraj) and delete blogs.

📱 Responsive Design – Mobile-friendly UI using Tailwind CSS.

💾 Persistent Storage – Blogs are stored in localStorage so they remain after page reloads.

🎨 Modern UI – Clean design with Google Fonts + Font Awesome icons.

🔒 Important Note

This is a front-end only project. The admin password is stored in the client-side code, which is not secure for production.
For real-world use, you would need a backend with proper authentication (e.g., Node.js, Express, or PHP + database).
